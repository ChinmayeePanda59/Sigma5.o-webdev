    <!-- Poem -->
    <p>
        Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
        Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br />
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br />
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br />
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br />
        And on the pedestal these words appear:<br />
        ‘My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings;<br />
        Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!’<br />
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
        Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br />
        The lone and level sands stretch far away.”<br />
    </p>
